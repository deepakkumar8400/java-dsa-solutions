## 📌 Part 1: Restaurant Management System

### 📖 Overview
A backend system for managing restaurant operations like menus, orders, customers, and billing.  
It follows **OOP principles**, uses **Java Collections Framework** for in-memory data handling, and connects to **MySQL** for persistent storage.

### ✨ Features
- **Modular Classes**: `Menu`, `Order`, `Customer`, `Billing`
- **Efficient Data Structures**: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `PriorityQueue`
- **Database Integration**: MySQL with **JDBC**
- **Security**: Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Transactions**: Ensure data consistency during multi-step operations
- **Multithreading**: Order processing & background tasks
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable for more features

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Libraries**: Java Collections Framework, JDBC
- **Concurrency**: Java Multithreading

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar8400/restaurant-management-system.git
   ```
2. Configure MySQL Database:
   - Create a database `restaurant_db`
   - Update DB credentials in `DBConnection.java`
3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
